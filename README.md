# Image Modernizer
Welcome to the Image Modernizer Repository! This repo is the home for Image Modernizer - a desktop software to modernize your images.

## Motivation
A few weeks ago, I checked out my website using AHREF's site audit tool and realized my PNG images were too big.
I googled how to fix this problem and resizing the images was not the most optimal solution - modernizing them to effective image formats was.

But how do you do that?

I googled that too and voila - I found a plethora of online converters. Just upload the image and be done with it.
But upload to where? Who's the owner of that site? What if I decide to operate an internal website and I don't want to upload the pictures to other servers?

There's absolutely no guarantee that website owners don't keep your images. They can say that they don't but you don't know for sure.
So, I decided to build my own open source converter. This is a desktop app that makes no requests to the internet and uses a very simple UI to convert your local images to WEBP - a modern image format that googlebot would love to see when it scans your website.

## How to use Image Modernizer?
Go to the releases page and download the software from the latest release.
Three platforms are currently supported: Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
Run Image Modernizer on the system you're using and you'll see a simple UI with a "Browse" button.
Select your PNG or JPEG image and let Image Modernizer do the rest. When done, it will ask you to select the destination for the new Webp copy of your image.

Enjoy!

## Next Steps
I don't have a lot of expertise making desktop apps but I do have vast knowledge in using Python as a backend engineer, and an open mind to learn more.
If you're interested in contributing to this project by adding more input and output formats, be my guest!
